**Important**: Count average values including tasks that a student did not try to solve (with 0 score). See the Printable String Spec example.

#### Printable String spec
It is multiline String containing a formatted table of all results and total values and marks.\
A format of your table should meet the following requirements: 
 
- Headers are required.\
- Column width depends on values lenghts.\
- Rows are sorted by students' last names.\
- Columns are sorted by the names of tasks.\
- Double values displayed with 2 digits after the decimal point.\
- Values of the column "Marl" are defined by average total score.\
- Pay attention to alignment of different columns.            
 
 
Example:

    Student        | Phalanxing | Shieldwalling | Tercioing | Wedging | Total | Mark |
    Eco Betty      |          0 |            83 |        89 |      59 | 57.75 |    F |
    Lodbrok Johnny |         61 |            92 |        67 |       0 | 55.00 |    F |

## Extra challenge
Avoid using cycles and `if` statements.
